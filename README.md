# luckyblock

version 1.16.5
I'm a beginner

If you place a block and destroy it, something will happen.
Occasionally, a Luckymob will spawn and drop a Luck Block when defeated.

No setting,

If you put NBT file in the Luckyblock folder, it will be loaded.

Commands
/lbget (amount) - Acquire lucky blocks.
/lbgive (player) (amount) - Gives you a lucky block.
/lbdo (number) - Execute the contents of the lucky block.
